2. [3p] When pressing "Load", the corresponding file content (if exists) is loaded into the text area txtContent.
3. [1p] If the username was not given, a popup dialog displays the message "username not given".
4. [2p] Save: when pressing the "Save" button, the content is saved into the corresponding text file.
5. [2p] Measure the time elapsed from loading the file to saving the new content.
